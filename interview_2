## üß† **DevOps & AWS Interview ‚Äî Questions and Correct Answers**

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What are NACLs and how are they different from Security Groups?**

**Answer:**

* **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)** act as **firewalls at the subnet level**.
* They are **stateless**, meaning both **inbound and outbound** rules must be explicitly defined.
* **Security Groups** act as firewalls at the **instance level** and are **stateful**, meaning return traffic is automatically allowed.
  **In short:**

> NACLs = Subnet-level, Stateless
> Security Groups = Instance-level, Stateful

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ What are EBS volumes and what are their different types?**

**Answer:**
EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides **persistent block storage** for EC2 instances.

**Types of EBS volumes:**

1. **gp2/gp3 (General Purpose SSD):** Balanced performance for general workloads.
2. **io1/io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD):** High-performance storage for critical databases.
3. **st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD):** For big data and large sequential workloads.
4. **sc1 (Cold HDD):** Low-cost storage for infrequently accessed data.
5. **Magnetic (Standard):** Legacy type, rarely used today.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ How would you design a secure 3-tier AWS application architecture?**

**Answer:**

* **Public Subnet:** Contains Application Load Balancer (ALB) or API Gateway for internet access.
* **Private Subnet (App Layer):** EC2 instances, ECS tasks, or EKS pods running the application.
* **Private Subnet (Database Layer):** RDS, Aurora, or DynamoDB.

**Security Measures:**

* Use **NACLs** and **Security Groups** with least privilege.
* Use **IAM roles** for secure access.
* **Encrypt data** with **KMS** (at rest) and **SSL/TLS** (in transit).
* Use **Secrets Manager** or **Parameter Store** for credentials.
* Enable **AWS WAF** and **Shield** for protection against attacks.
* Enable **CloudTrail**, **Config**, and **CloudWatch** for logging and monitoring.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ What is data encryption at rest and in transit?**

**Answer:**

* **Encryption at rest:** Protects stored data (e.g., S3, EBS, RDS) using **AWS KMS-managed keys**.
* **Encryption in transit:** Protects data during transfer using **SSL/TLS certificates**.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between server-side and client-side encryption.**

**Answer:**

* **Server-Side Encryption (SSE):** AWS encrypts the data after receiving it and before storing it (e.g., SSE-S3, SSE-KMS).
* **Client-Side Encryption:** The client encrypts data **before** sending it to AWS; AWS stores only the encrypted data.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Why is Auto Scaling used and what are its types?**

**Answer:**
Auto Scaling automatically adjusts resources based on demand to maintain performance and reduce cost.

**Types:**

1. **Dynamic Scaling:** Based on metrics like CPU utilization (CloudWatch alarms).
2. **Scheduled Scaling:** Scales resources at specific times.
3. **Predictive Scaling:** Uses machine learning to predict traffic patterns and scale accordingly.

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ What is connection draining (deregistration delay)?**

**Answer:**
Connection draining allows existing requests to complete before an instance is deregistered or terminated from a load balancer.
It prevents users from losing connections during deployments or scaling activities.

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ What is Docker and how does Kubernetes relate to Docker?**

**Answer:**

* **Docker** is a platform for containerizing applications and their dependencies to ensure consistent environments.
* **Kubernetes** is a **container orchestration tool** that automates deployment, scaling, and management of Docker containers across multiple nodes.
  It adds features like load balancing, auto-healing, and auto-scaling that Docker alone doesn‚Äôt provide.

---

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ What is the `imagePullPolicy` in Kubernetes?**

**Answer:**
The `imagePullPolicy` defines when Kubernetes should pull container images from the registry.

**Values:**

* **Always:** Always pull the image from the registry.
* **IfNotPresent:** Pull only if the image is not available locally.
* **Never:** Never pull; use the local image only.

---

### **üîü What is a Service in Kubernetes and what are its types?**

**Answer:**
A **Service** in Kubernetes exposes a set of Pods as a network service for communication inside or outside the cluster.

**Types of Services:**

1. **ClusterIP (default):** Internal communication within the cluster.
2. **NodePort:** Exposes the service on each node‚Äôs IP and a specific port.
3. **LoadBalancer:** Exposes the service externally via a cloud provider‚Äôs load balancer.
4. **ExternalName:** Maps the service to an external DNS name.
5. *(Optional)* **Headless Service (ClusterIP: None):** Direct pod-to-pod access.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between Deployment and DaemonSet in Kubernetes.**

**Answer:**

* **Deployment:** Manages replicas of pods and ensures the desired number of pods are running. Used for web or app services.
* **DaemonSet:** Ensures **one pod runs on every node** (or specific nodes). Commonly used for agents like logging or monitoring tools (Fluentd, Prometheus Node Exporter).

### **1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.**

**Answer:**

| Feature     | SQL                       | NoSQL                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Model  | Structured (tables, rows) | Unstructured or semi-structured (documents, key-value, graph) |
| Schema      | Fixed schema              | Dynamic schema                                                |
| Consistency | ACID (strong consistency) | BASE (eventual consistency)                                   |
| Scalability | Vertical scaling          | Horizontal scaling                                            |
| Example     | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle | DynamoDB, MongoDB, Cassandra                                  |

**Answer (Example ‚Äî Lambda Runtime Upgrade Project):**

> **Situation:** Our client had 1,300 AWS Lambda functions using deprecated runtimes (Python 3.7, Node.js 12).
> **Task:** Upgrade all Lambda functions to supported runtimes without impacting production.
> **Action:**
>
> * Used **AWS CLI** and **boto3** scripts to automate runtime updates.
> * Updated Lambda layers and coordinated with app teams for testing.
> * Used tagging and automation to track migration progress.
>   **Result:**
> * Upgraded over **1,100 functions** successfully within 3 weeks, improving security compliance and removing deprecated code.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ What monitoring tools or practices have you used?**

**Answer:**
I use **Amazon CloudWatch** for monitoring metrics, logs, and alarms.
I‚Äôve also created dashboards using **Amazon QuickSight** for visual insights.
For deeper observability, I integrate **CloudTrail** for API activity logging and **AWS X-Ray** for tracing requests through microservices.
In Kubernetes environments, **Prometheus** and **Grafana** are common choices for monitoring and visualization.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Explain `count` and `for_each` in Terraform.**

**Answer:**
Both `count` and `for_each` are used to **create multiple resources dynamically** in Terraform.

* **count:** Uses an integer to create a fixed number of identical resources.

  ```hcl
  resource "aws_instance" "server" {
    count = 3
    ami   = "ami-12345"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
  }
  ```

  ‚û§ Creates 3 EC2 instances.

* **for_each:** Iterates over a map or set, allowing unique identifiers.

  ```hcl
  resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    for_each = toset(["dev", "stage", "prod"])
    ami      = "ami-12345"
    tags = { Name = each.key }
  }
  ```

  ‚û§ Creates instances named dev, stage, and prod.
